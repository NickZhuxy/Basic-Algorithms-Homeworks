    %Problem 1A
    \begin{tcolorbox}[title={Problem 1A (Recurrence Relations â€” 3 Styles, 9 pts)}]
        Use induction to show the asymptotic run-time corresponding to the following recurrence relation is $O(\log^2(n))$. \textbf{Do not use the Master Theorem here.}
        \begin{center}
            $T(0) = T(1) = 1$. For all $n\geq 2$, $T(n) = T(\lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil-1) + \log n$.

    %Problem 1B
    \begin{tcolorbox}[title={Problem 1B (9 pts)}]
        Use a recursion tree to find the asymptotic run-time corresponding to the following recurrence relation. You may assume any fractional input to $T$ is the greatest integer less than it (e.g., $T(\frac{2n}{3}) = T(\lfloor\frac{2n}{3}\rfloor)$).
        \begin{center}
            $T(0) = T(1) = 1$. For all $n\geq 2$, $T(n) = T(\frac{2n}{3}) + T(\frac{n}{5}) + n$

    %Problem 1C
    \begin{tcolorbox}[title={Problem 1C (12 pts)}]
        Find the asymptotic run-time corresponding to each of the following recurrence relations using the Master Theorem. For each, explain which case of the Master Theorem applies and why.
        \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
            \item $T(n) = 2T(\frac{n}{5}) + \sqrt{2n}$.
            \item $T(n) = 3T(\frac{n}{3}) + n/2$.
            \item $T(n) = 4T(\frac{n}{2}) + n\log n$.

    %Problem 2
    \begin{tcolorbox}[title={Problem 2 (Array Search, 30 pts)}]
        You are given an array of $n$ integers $a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n$. Give an $O(\log n)$ algorithm that outputs an index $i$ where $a_i = i$, or outputs $\bot$ if such $i$ does not exist. Justify the correctness and time complexity of your proposed algorithm.

    %Problem 3
    \begin{tcolorbox}[title={Problem 3 (Malfunctioning Phones, 40 pts)}]
        A manufacturer has a recall on a set of $n$ cell phones, some of which have a malfunction which makes them unreliable. The manufacturer has built a machine that allows a pair of phones to test each other's correctness. Let $C_1, C_2$ be a pair of phones. The machine $M$ runs in the following way:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item $M(C_1, C_2) = 11$ if both phones say the other is working.
            \item $M(C_1, C_2) = 10$ if one phone says the other is working and one phone says the other is malfunctioning. 
            \item $M(C_1, C_2) = 00$ if both phones say the other is malfunctioning. 
        \end{enumerate}
        Remember that malfunctioning phones cannot be trusted, so they may lie, tell the truth, or throw out a random response. Working phones, on the other hand, can be assumed to know if the other phone is working or malfunctioning always. 
        \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
            \item Show that if you know at least one working phone, all other working phones can be found by using $O(n)$ queries to $M$.
            \item Assume the majority of the phones are working, i.e., there are greater than $n/2$ working phones. Give an algorithm that can find a working phone in $O(n)$ queries to $M$. Justify the correctness and time complexity of your proposed algorithm. [Hint: Start by explaining how to use $O(n)$ queries to reduce the problem size by a constant factor.]
            \item Assume the majority of the phones are malfunctioning, i.e., there are fewer than $n/2$ working phones. Is there still a procedure (using $M$) that is guaranteed to find a working phone? Give a brief justification.
        \end{enumerate}
