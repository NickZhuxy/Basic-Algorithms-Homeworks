    \end{tcolorbox}
    %Write your solution here!
    \section*{Solution}

        We will use induction to show that \( T(n)=O((\log n)^2) \).

        \textbf{Base Case:}  
        For \( n = 0 \) and \( n = 1 \), we have:
        \[
        T(0)=T(1)=1.
        \]
        This satisfies the bound \( T(n) \le C (\log n)^2 \) for any constant \( C \) 
        (for these small values, the statement is vacuously true or we choose \( C \) large enough to cover these cases).

        \textbf{Inductive Hypothesis:}  
        Assume that for all \( k < n \) there exists a constant \( C > \frac{1}{2} \) such that:
        \[
        T(k) \le C (\log k)^2.
        \]

        \textbf{Inductive Step:}  
        For \( n \ge 2 \), we have:
        \[
        T(n) = T\Big(\Big\lceil\frac{n}{2}\Big\rceil-1\Big) + \log n.
        \]
        Since:
        \[
        \Big\lceil\frac{n}{2}\Big\rceil - 1 \le \frac{n}{2},
        \]
        the inductive hypothesis implies:
        \[
        T(n) \le C \left(\log \frac{n}{2}\right)^2 + \log n.
        \]
        since \( \log \frac{n}{2} = \log n - 1 \), we have:
        \[
        T(n) \le C (\log n - 1)^2 + \log n.
        \]
        Expanding the inequality, we have:
        \[
        T(n) \le C\left[(\log n)^2 - 2\log n + 1\right] + \log n = C (\log n)^2 - 2C \log n + C + \log n.
        \]
        and this simplifies to:
        \[
        T(n) \le C (\log n)^2 - (2C - 1)\log n + C.
        \]
        For the inequality \( T(n) \le C (\log n)^2 \) to hold, it is sufficient that:
        \[
        -(2C - 1)\log n + C \le 0.
        \]
        This inequality is satisfied for all sufficiently large \( n \) provided:
        \[
        2C - 1 > 0 \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad C > \frac{1}{2}.
        \]
        Thus, by choosing any constant \( C > \frac{1}{2} \), the inductive step is verified.

        \textbf{Conclusion:}  
        By mathematical induction, for all sufficiently large \( n \),
        \[
        T(n) \le C (\log n)^2.
        \]
        Hence, we conclude that \( T(n)=O((\log n)^2) \).

    %Problem 1B
    \begin{tcolorbox}[title={Problem 1B (9 pts)}]
        Use a recursion tree to find the asymptotic run-time corresponding to the following recurrence relation. You may assume any fractional input to $T$ is the greatest integer less than it (e.g., $T(\frac{2n}{3}) = T(\lfloor\frac{2n}{3}\rfloor)$).
        \begin{center}
            $T(0) = T(1) = 1$. For all $n\geq 2$, $T(n) = T(\frac{2n}{3}) + T(\frac{n}{5}) + n$
        \end{center}
    \end{tcolorbox}
    %Write your solution here!
    \section*{Solution}

    Given the recurrence, we will first draw the recursion tree, then use it to sum all the costs to reach the conclusion.

    \textbf{Step 1: Constructing the Recursion Tree}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Level 0 (Root):} The cost is \( n \).
        \item \textbf{Level 1:} The recurrence splits into two subproblems of sizes \(\frac{2n}{3}\) and \(\frac{n}{5}\). 
        Therefore, the cost at this level is:
        \[
        \frac{2n}{3} + \frac{n}{5} = \frac{13n}{15}.
        \]
        \item \textbf{Level \(i\):} At any node with subproblem size \( x \), the work done is proportional to \( x \). 
        Since each node produces subproblems of sizes \(\frac{2}{3}x\) and \(\frac{1}{5}x\), the sum of the subproblem sizes is:
        \[
        \frac{2}{3}x+\frac{1}{5}x = \frac{13}{15}x.
        \]
        Hence, if the total cost at level \(i\) is \( n\left(\frac{13}{15}\right)^i \), then the total cost at level \(i+1\) is:
        \[
        n\left(\frac{13}{15}\right)^{i+1}.
        \]
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Step 2: Summing the Costs}

    The total work is the sum over all levels until the subproblems become constant (which happens after \( \Theta(\log n) \) levels):
    \[
    T(n) = n + \frac{13n}{15} + \left(\frac{13}{15}\right)^2 n + \cdots.
    \]
    This is a geometric series with common ratio \( \frac{13}{15} < 1 \). Thus, the sum is:
    \[
    T(n) \le n \sum_{i=0}^{\infty}\left(\frac{13}{15}\right)^i
    = n \cdot \frac{1}{1-\frac{13}{15}}
    = n \cdot \frac{1}{\frac{2}{15}}
    = \frac{15}{2}n.
    \]
    Therefore,
    \[
    T(n) = \Theta(n).
    \]

    %Problem 1C
    \begin{tcolorbox}[title={Problem 1C (12 pts)}]
        Find the asymptotic run-time corresponding to each of the following recurrence relations using the Master Theorem. For each, explain which case of the Master Theorem applies and why.
        \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
            \item $T(n) = 2T(\frac{n}{5}) + \sqrt{2n}$.
            \item $T(n) = 3T(\frac{n}{3}) + n/2$.
            \item $T(n) = 4T(\frac{n}{2}) + n\log n$.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{tcolorbox}
    %Write your solution here!
    \section*{Solution}

    \textbf{(a) } Consider the recurrence 
    \[
    T(n)=2T\left(\frac{n}{5}\right)+\sqrt{2n}.
    \]
    We have:
    \[
    a=2,\quad b=5,\quad f(n)=\sqrt{2n}=\Theta(\sqrt{n}).
    \]
    \[
    Q = n^{\log_b a}=n^{\log_5 2}=\Theta\left(n^{\log_5 2}\right).
    \]
    Since numerically \(\log_5 2\approx 0.4307\), we have:
    \[
    n^{\log_5 2} = \Theta\left(n^{0.4307}\right).
    \]
    Comparing \(f(n)=\Theta\left(n^{0.5}\right)\) with \(n^{0.4307}\), we see that
    \[
    f(n)=\Omega\left(n^{\log_5 2+\epsilon}\right) \quad \text{for } \epsilon\approx 0.0693>0.
    \]
    Moreover, the regularity condition holds since
    \[
    a\, f\left(\frac{n}{b}\right)=2\,\Theta\left(\sqrt{\frac{n}{5}}\right)=\Theta\left(\sqrt{n}\right)
    \]
    with a constant factor \(2/\sqrt{5}<1\). Hence, by Case 3 of the Master Theorem,
    \[
    T(n)=\Theta\left(f(n)\right)=\Theta\left(\sqrt{n}\right).
    \]

    \bigskip

    \textbf{(b) } Consider the recurrence 
    \[
    T(n)=3T\left(\frac{n}{3}\right)+\frac{n}{2}.
    \]
    Here, we have:
    \[
    a=3,\quad b=3,\quad f(n)=\frac{n}{2}=\Theta(n).
    \]
    The critical exponent is:
    \[
    n^{\log_b a}=n^{\log_3 3}=n.
    \]
    Since \(f(n)=\Theta(n)=\Theta\left(n^{\log_3 3}\right)\), this corresponds to Case 2 of the Master Theorem. Thus,
    \[
    T(n)=\Theta(n\log n).
    \]

    \bigskip

    \textbf{(c) } Consider the recurrence 
    \[
    T(n)=4T\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)+n\log n.
    \]
    We identify:
    \[
    a=4,\quad b=2,\quad f(n)=n\log n.
    \]
    The critical exponent is:
    \[
    n^{\log_b a}=n^{\log_2 4}=n^2.
    \]
    Since \(n\log n = o(n^2)\), we can write \(f(n)=O\big(n^{2-\epsilon}\big)\) for some \(0<\epsilon<1\) (for instance, \(\epsilon=0.5\)). Therefore, by Case 1 of the Master Theorem,
    \[
    T(n)=\Theta(n^2).
    \]

    %Problem 3
    \begin{tcolorbox}[title={Problem 3 (Malfunctioning Phones, 40 pts)}]
        A manufacturer has a recall on a set of $n$ cell phones, some of which have a malfunction which makes them unreliable. The manufacturer has built a machine that allows a pair of phones to test each other's correctness. Let $C_1, C_2$ be a pair of phones. The machine $M$ runs in the following way:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item $M(C_1, C_2) = 11$ if both phones say the other is working.
            \item $M(C_1, C_2) = 10$ if one phone says the other is working and one phone says the other is malfunctioning. 
            \item $M(C_1, C_2) = 00$ if both phones say the other is malfunctioning. 
        \end{enumerate}
        Remember that malfunctioning phones cannot be trusted, so they may lie, tell the truth, or throw out a random response. Working phones, on the other hand, can be assumed to know if the other phone is working or malfunctioning always. 
        \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
            \item Show that if you know at least one working phone, all other working phones can be found by using $O(n)$ queries to $M$.
            \item Assume the majority of the phones are working, i.e., there are greater than $n/2$ working phones. Give an algorithm that can find a working phone in $O(n)$ queries to $M$. Justify the correctness and time complexity of your proposed algorithm. [Hint: Start by explaining how to use $O(n)$ queries to reduce the problem size by a constant factor.]
            \item Assume the majority of the phones are malfunctioning, i.e., there are fewer than $n/2$ working phones. Is there still a procedure (using $M$) that is guaranteed to find a working phone? Give a brief justification.
