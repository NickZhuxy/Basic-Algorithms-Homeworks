    %Problem 1
    \begin{tcolorbox}[title={Problem 1 (Divide and Conquer the Peak, 30 pts)}]
        Suppose we have an array $A$ of $n$ distinct integers and moreover are guaranteed that the array has the following property: up to some index $1\leq i \leq n$, $A$ is increasing, i.e., $A[1] < A[2] < \ldots < A[i]$, and then after index $i$, $A$ is decreasing, i.e., $A[i] > A[i+1] > \ldots > A[n]$. In this array, we call $A[i]$ the \emph{peak} of $A$. For example, consider the array $[1, 4, 7, 8, 6, 2]$, which has peak $8$. 
        \medskip
        
        Create an algorithm that finds the peak of an input array $A$ in sublinear time (i.e. $o(n)$). Justify the correctness and time complexity of your proposed algorithm.
    \end{tcolorbox}
    %Write your solution here!
    \section*{Solution}
    The key observation is that since the array is first increasing and then decreasing, a binary search can be employed to efficiently find the peak. Let \( \text{low} \) and \( \text{high} \) denote the current bounds of the search interval. At each step, compute
    \[
    \text{mid} = \left\lfloor \frac{\text{low} + \text{high}}{2} \right\rfloor.
    \]
    Then, compare \( A[\text{mid}] \) with \( A[\text{mid}+1] \):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If \( A[\text{mid}] < A[\text{mid}+1] \), then the array is still increasing at \( \text{mid} \), so the peak must lie in the right half. Set \( \text{low} = \text{mid} + 1 \).
        \item Otherwise, if \( A[\text{mid}] > A[\text{mid}+1] \), then the peak is either at \( \text{mid} \) or to its left, so set \( \text{high} = \text{mid} \).
    \end{itemize}
    The loop terminates when \( \text{low} = \text{high} \), and at that point, \( A[\text{low}] \) is the peak.

    \textbf{Correctness:} \\
    The algorithm maintains the invariant that the peak is always within the interval \([\,\text{low},\, \text{high}]\). At each iteration:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If \( A[\text{mid}] < A[\text{mid}+1] \), the increasing property guarantees that the peak lies in the interval \([\text{mid}+1, \text{high}]\).
        \item If \( A[\text{mid}] \geq A[\text{mid}+1] \), the peak is in \([\text{low}, \text{mid}]\) since either \( A[\text{mid}] \) is the peak or the peak lies to its left.
    \end{itemize}
    When the loop terminates with \( \text{low} = \text{high} \), only one element remains, and by our invariant, it must be the peak.
    
    \bigskip
    
    \textbf{Time Complexity:} \\
    At each iteration, the search space is reduced by roughly half. Therefore, the number of iterations is \( O(\log n) \), which is sublinear with respect to \( n \).

    %Problem 2
    \begin{tcolorbox}[title={Problem 2 (Two-Server Search, 35 pts)}]
        You have (limited) access to two databases, each of which contains $n$ numbers. For simplicity, you may assume each value across the $2n$ entries is unique. You may only query the databases in the following way: You give one of the databases an integer $1\leq k \leq n$, and it responds with the $k$-th smallest number in its database.
        \medskip
        
        Give a divide-and-conquer algorithm that finds the median value across all $2n$ entries using $O(\log n)$ queries to the servers. Justify the correctness and time complexity of your proposed algorithm.
    \end{tcolorbox}
    %Write your solution here!
    \section*{Solution}
    We view the two databases as two sorted arrays \( A \) and \( B \) of length \( n \) each. The median is the \( n \)-th smallest element in the union \( A \cup B \). Using a divide-and-conquer strategy, we define a recursive subroutine \textsc{KthSmallest} that finds the \( k \)-th smallest element in the union. At each recursive step, we:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Set \( i = \min\{ \lfloor k/2 \rfloor, \text{number of remaining elements in } A \} \) and similarly \( j = \min\{ \lfloor k/2 \rfloor, \text{number of remaining elements in } B \} \).
        \item Query the databases to obtain \( a = \text{Query}(A, L_A + i - 1) \) and \( b = \text{Query}(B, L_B + j - 1) \).
        \item Compare \( a \) and \( b \): if \( a < b \), then the first \( i \) elements in \( A \) cannot contain the \( k \)-th smallest element, so we discard them and reduce \( k \) by \( i \); otherwise, we discard the first \( j \) elements in \( B \) and reduce \( k \) by \( j \).
    \end{itemize}
    By discarding at least \(\lfloor k/2 \rfloor\) elements in each recursive call, the recursion depth is \( O(\log n) \), ensuring that the total number of queries is \( O(\log n) \).
    
    \bigskip
    
    \textbf{Pseudocode:} \\
    Note: The query operation, which returns the \( k \)-th smallest number in a database, is assumed to be provided.

    \par\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}
    
    \bigskip
    
    \textbf{Correctness and Time Complexity:} \\
    The correctness follows by induction on \( k \). At every step, the algorithm maintains that the \( k \)-th smallest element in the union of the remaining elements of \( A \) and \( B \) is preserved. By discarding at least \(\lfloor k/2 \rfloor\) elements in each call, the recursion depth is \( O(\log n) \). Since each recursive call issues only a constant number of queries, the overall query complexity is \( O(\log n) \).
