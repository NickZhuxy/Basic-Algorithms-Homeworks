    %Problem 1
    \begin{tcolorbox}[title={Problem 1 (Divide and Conquer the Peak, 30 pts)}]
        Suppose we have an array $A$ of $n$ distinct integers and moreover are guaranteed that the array has the following property: up to some index $1\leq i \leq n$, $A$ is increasing, i.e., $A[1] < A[2] < \ldots < A[i]$, and then after index $i$, $A$ is decreasing, i.e., $A[i] > A[i+1] > \ldots > A[n]$. In this array, we call $A[i]$ the \emph{peak} of $A$. For example, consider the array $[1, 4, 7, 8, 6, 2]$, which has peak $8$. 
        \medskip
        
        Create an algorithm that finds the peak of an input array $A$ in sublinear time (i.e. $o(n)$). Justify the correctness and time complexity of your proposed algorithm.
    \end{tcolorbox}
    %Write your solution here!
    \section*{Solution}
    The key observation is that since the array is first increasing and then decreasing, a binary search can be employed to efficiently find the peak. Let \( \text{low} \) and \( \text{high} \) denote the current bounds of the search interval. At each step, compute
    \[
    \text{mid} = \left\lfloor \frac{\text{low} + \text{high}}{2} \right\rfloor.
    \]
    Then, compare \( A[\text{mid}] \) with \( A[\text{mid}+1] \):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If \( A[\text{mid}] < A[\text{mid}+1] \), then the array is still increasing at \( \text{mid} \), so the peak must lie in the right half. Set \( \text{low} = \text{mid} + 1 \).
        \item Otherwise, if \( A[\text{mid}] > A[\text{mid}+1] \), then the peak is either at \( \text{mid} \) or to its left, so set \( \text{high} = \text{mid} \).
    \end{itemize}
    The loop terminates when \( \text{low} = \text{high} \), and at that point, \( A[\text{low}] \) is the peak.

    \textbf{Correctness:} \\
    The algorithm maintains the invariant that the peak is always within the interval \([\,\text{low},\, \text{high}]\). At each iteration:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If \( A[\text{mid}] < A[\text{mid}+1] \), the increasing property guarantees that the peak lies in the interval \([\text{mid}+1, \text{high}]\).
        \item If \( A[\text{mid}] \geq A[\text{mid}+1] \), the peak is in \([\text{low}, \text{mid}]\) since either \( A[\text{mid}] \) is the peak or the peak lies to its left.
    \end{itemize}
    When the loop terminates with \( \text{low} = \text{high} \), only one element remains, and by our invariant, it must be the peak.
    
    \bigskip
    
    \textbf{Time Complexity:} \\
    At each iteration, the search space is reduced by roughly half. Therefore, the number of iterations is \( O(\log n) \), which is sublinear with respect to \( n \).

    %Problem 2
    \begin{tcolorbox}[title={Problem 2 (Two-Server Search, 35 pts)}]
        You have (limited) access to two databases, each of which contains $n$ numbers. For simplicity, you may assume each value across the $2n$ entries is unique. You may only query the databases in the following way: You give one of the databases an integer $1\leq k \leq n$, and it responds with the $k$-th smallest number in its database.
        \medskip
        
        Give a divide-and-conquer algorithm that finds the median value across all $2n$ entries using $O(\log n)$ queries to the servers. Justify the correctness and time complexity of your proposed algorithm.
    \end{tcolorbox}
    %Write your solution here!
    \section*{Solution}
    We can view the two databases as two sorted arrays \( A \) and \( B \) of length \( n \) each. 
    The median of the \( 2n \) entries is the \( n \)-th smallest element overall. 
    We use a divide-and-conquer strategy to find the \( k \)-th smallest element in the union of two sorted arrays.
    At each step, we compare the elements at appropriately chosen positions in \( A \) and \( B \) and discard a portion of one array that cannot contain the \( k \)-th smallest element. This recursion decreases the effective search size by roughly a factor of 2 per iteration, leading to \( O(\log n) \) queries.
    
    Since we can only access each database by querying for a specific order statistic, we simulate array access by issuing queries such as \(\text{Query}(A, k)\) to get the \( k \)-th smallest element in \( A \).
    
    \bigskip
    
    \textbf{Algorithm Details:} \\
    We first define a recursive subroutine \textsc{KthSmallest} that, given current index bounds in \( A \) and \( B \) and a number \( k \), returns the \( k \)-th smallest element in the union of the subarrays. The base cases handle when one database is exhausted or when \( k = 1 \). In the recursive step, let
    \[
    i = \min(\text{number of remaining elements in } A, \lfloor k/2 \rfloor)
    \]
    and
    \[
    j = \min(\text{number of remaining elements in } B, \lfloor k/2 \rfloor).
    \]
    We query for \( a = \text{Query}(A, L_A+i-1) \) and \( b = \text{Query}(B, L_B+j-1) \) (where \( L_A \) and \( L_B \) are the current lower indices for \( A \) and \( B \) respectively). If \( a < b \), then the first \( i \) elements of \( A \) can be discarded; otherwise, discard the first \( j \) elements of \( B \). Recursively adjust \( k \) accordingly.

    \bigskip
    
    \textbf{Correctness and Time Complexity:} \\
    At every recursive call, the algorithm maintains the invariant that the \( k \)-th smallest element in the union of the remaining portions of \( A \) and \( B \) is preserved. By comparing \(\text{Query}(A, L_A+i-1)\) and \(\text{Query}(B, L_B+j-1)\), we can safely discard \( i \) or \( j \) elements from one database, ensuring that the new problem size reduces \( k \) by at least \(\lfloor k/2 \rfloor\). Therefore, the depth of the recursion is \( O(\log n) \), and each recursive call makes only \( O(1) \) queries. Consequently, the overall algorithm uses \( O(\log n) \) queries.
